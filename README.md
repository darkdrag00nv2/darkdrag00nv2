### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer interested in Blockchains. I am primarily involved in the Flow & Internet Computer ecosystems.

These days, I work with Rust & Go. In the past, I've used C++, Python, TypeScript & Scala as well.

I am available for any part-time remote opportunities in Blockchain and Web3. Hit me up at darkdrag00n[@]proton.me
