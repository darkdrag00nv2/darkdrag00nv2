### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software engineer interested in Blockchains. I am primarily involved in the Ergo & Internet Computer ecosystems.

These days, I work with Rust, TypeScript and Scala. In the past, I've used C++ & Python as well.

I am available for any remote opportunities in Blockchain and Web3. Hit me up at darkdrag00n[@]proton.me
